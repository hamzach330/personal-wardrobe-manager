# AI Agent Skills

This file defines how AI agents must THINK, DECIDE, and ACT
when contributing to this repository.

AI agents are collaborators, not authors of new systems.

---

## Responsibilities

- Read all relevant skills files before making changes
- Follow existing architecture, patterns, and conventions
- Ask for clarification if requirements, scope, or intent are unclear
- Prefer existing solutions over introducing new ones

---

## Decision Rules

Agents MUST ask before proceeding if:
- A change affects architecture or folder structure
- A new dependency is required
- Behavior is not explicitly defined
- Multiple valid approaches exist

Agents MAY proceed without asking if:
- Changes are localized and follow existing patterns
- The task is clearly defined and low risk
- No architectural or behavioral changes are introduced

---

## Change Boundaries

Agents MAY:
- Add features following existing architecture
- Refactor locally for readability
-
